# Postmatic respects your privacy. 
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your personal data when you use the Postmatic platform (the “Service”), as well as your rights regarding that data.

We collect several types of data to support the operation and improvement of the service:
- Identity Data: Name, email address, phone number (for registration, login, and communication).
- Business Data: Business name/brand, business category, MSME sector/content creator.

- Analytics Data: User interaction data, content performance, and other technical data collected through analytics tools for service improvement.
- Social Media Data (Optional): If you integrate social media accounts (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook), we collect the required API access data (username, account ID, access token) as per the permission you provide.
We do not collect sensitive data such as ID card/SIM/NPWP except for business payment verification purposes (and only when absolutely necessary). We do not access private messages on social media; only the data you authorize through the OAuth API process we integrate with will be accessed.
